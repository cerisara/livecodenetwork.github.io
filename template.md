# Introduction

When making bibliographic references, authors may be referenced
inline, e.g. @Schwitters32 wrote the Ursonate sound poem, or in
parenthesis, e.g. Ursonate is a sound poem [@Schwitters32]. Multiple
references should be grouped together like so
[@Schwitters32;@Miller56;@Greenewalt46].

# Figures

Images should be included as figures, with captions provided and
formatted as shown below:

![**Figure 2:** *A descriptive caption should be given for all figures, understandable without reference to the rest of the article.*](canute3.jpg)

The size of the image on the page may be set by editing the image file
itself. For photographs, please provide a resolution of at least 300
DPI. Be prepared for the page layout and image size to be changed
during the print design process, and consider this when refering to
the figures in the text.
