The co-chair of ICLC'14 just made it: conference proceedings in Markdown !
This is just a great achievement I think, because I'm really fed-up with all these conf papers in PDF that can only be read on
big and large desktop screens and on plain paper.

I do like to read papers on web pages, on small screens, even smartphones (yes I do read papers on smartphones !).
I'm found of reading papers just like ebooks on Kindle or ebook reader, where you can change the font size and the text reflows;
this is very useful because my eyes are very bad (and not because I read on smartphones :-P ), this is great for accessibility !

Markdown also makes life realy easier for publication chair: no more font, format, layout issues !
And it's also much easier to write for authors who are still struggling in latex.

So why sticking to this damn PDF format !?!
It's more than time to switch to markdown no: there are great tools to cnovert to any other format (see pandoc), to support fast
and nice equations (see katex), support for bibtex and support for integration in books (see gitbook).
