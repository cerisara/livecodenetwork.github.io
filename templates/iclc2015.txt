# Introduction

Welcome to the markdown (aka commonmark) template for the first
International Conference on Live Coding, 2015.

This document is a guide to using markdown for the conference, which
is itself written in markdown. For full understanding, refer to
template.txt to see the markdown source, and template.pdf to see the
typeset output.

We suggest you take a copy of template.txt source, and use it as a
starting point for your ICLC paper.

It is unusual for a conference to ask for papers to be created in this
markdown format. We have done so to enable us to make proceedings
available both in PDF files suitable for print, and in HTML suitable
for the web. This is important for making sure your paper is fully
accessible, via Internet search, and with assistive technology such as
screen readers for blind people.

**If you do not wish to learn markdown, please do not be discouraged
from submitting your paper**, there is also a word document template
available.

# Learning and using markdown

We realise learning new technology takes time, but we are happy to
answer any questions you have. This is best done via our online
community forum:
  [http://lurk.org/groups/lcrn/](http://lurk.org/groups/lcrn/)

Alternatively you may email the conference chairs directly:
  [livecodenet@gmail.com](mailto:livecodenet@gmail.com)

## Running pandoc {#pandoc}

Pandoc is software which turns text written in markdown into a
beautiful looking document, complete with references. You will need to
run it to create PDF documents of your paper for checking and
uploading for submission.

You may download pandoc for all major operating systems (including MS
Windows, Apple Mac OS and GNU/Linux) from the following website:
[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)

To render your markdown source as HTML to view in your web browser,
use the following command from a terminal window:

~~~
pandoc --template=pandoc/iclc.html --filter pandoc-citeproc \
   --number-sections iclc2015.txt -o iclc2015.html
~~~

The above assumes you have your bibliography stored in file called
references.bib, using the BibTeX format. Pandoc also supports EndNote,
RIS and other formats, just change the filename in the above command
accordingly.

To produce a PDF instead, you can use the following, although you will
need LaTeX installed (see
[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html) for where to get it
from).

~~~
pandoc --template=pandoc/iclc.latex --filter pandoc-citeproc \
   --number-sections iclc2015.txt -o iclc2015.pdf
~~~

## Bibliographic references

When making bibliographic references, authors may be referenced
inline, e.g. @Schwitters32 wrote the Ursonate sound poem, or in
parenthesis, e.g. Ursonate is a sound poem [@Schwitters32]. Multiple
references should be grouped together like so
[@Schwitters32;@Miller56;@Greenewalt46].

The pandoc command given in the [above section](#pandoc) will automatically
render your references according to Chicago author-date style.

## Figures

Images should be included as figures, with captions provided and
formatted as shown below:

![*A descriptive caption should be given for all figures, understandable without reference to the rest of the article.*](images/pomeroy.jpg)

The size of the image on the page may be set by editing the image file
itself. For photographs, please provide a resolution of at least 300
DPI. Be prepared for the page layout and image size to be changed
during the print design process, and consider this when referring to
the figures in the text.

# Conclusion
