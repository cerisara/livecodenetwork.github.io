# Markdown / commonmark

This is the recommended format, as it allows us to publish acceoted papers both as PDF with print layout, and online as a webpage.

You create markdown documents by writing in plain text, with simple formatting markup. For example to italicise text, you surround it with asterixes, \*like this\*.

For information about software you can use to make editing markdown straightforward, as well as instructions on how to do easy bibliographic referencing, please refer to the template itself.

Papers submitted using this format will be published in the proceedings in PDF form, but not on the web in HTML. The template comes in the form of an ODF document, where you replace the example text with that of your paper.

# Microsoft word template
