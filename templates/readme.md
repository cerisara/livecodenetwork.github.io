# International Conference on Live Coding - guidelines and templates

There are two templates available, in *markdown* (also known as
*commonmark*) format, and microsoft word.

## Markdown / commonmark

This is the recommended format, as it allows us to publish accepted
papers both as PDF with print layout, and online as a webpage.

You create markdown documents by writing a text file, with simple
markup to specify formatting, citations and the inclusion of images in
a standard way. For more information please refer to the template
itself, which is [iclc2015.txt](iclc2015.txt).

## Microsoft word template

This is for people without the time or energy to invest in learning
how to use markdown template. Papers submitted using the Microsoft
Word template will be published in the proceedings in PDF form, but
not on the web in HTML. The template comes in the form of a word
document, where you replace the example text with that of your paper. The template is [iclc2015.docx](iclc2015.docx).
