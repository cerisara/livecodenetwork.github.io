{"name":"International Conference on Live Coding","tagline":"Leeds, UK, 13-15th July 2015","body":"## Welcome to the website for ICLC 2015.\r\n\r\n<p>With pleasure we announce the call for papers and performances for the first International Conference on Live Coding, hosted by ICSRiM in the School of Music, University of Leeds, UK, and funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council via the Live Coding Research Network.</p>\r\n\r\nThis conference follows a long line of international events on liveness in computer programming; the [http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de/MusicTechnology/609](Changing Grammars) live audio programming symposium in Hamburg 2004, the [http://livecode.access-space.org/](LOSS Livecode) festival in Sheffield 2007, the annual [http://vivo.cenart.tv/](Vivo) festivals in Mexico City from 2012, the [http://livecode.access-space.org/](live.code.festival) in Karlsruhe, the [http://liveprogramming.github.io/2013/](LIVE) workshop at ICSE on live programming, and Dagstuhl Seminar 13382 on [http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2014/4420/](Collaboration and Learning through Live Coding) in 2013, as well as numerous workshops, concerts, algoraves and conference special sessions. It also follows a series of Live Coding Research Network symposia on diverse topics, and the activities of the [http://toplap.org/](TOPLAP) community since 2004. We hope that this conference will act as a confluence for all this work, helping establish live coding as an interdisciplinary field, exploring liveness in symbolic abstractions, and understanding the perceptual, creative, productive, philosophical and cultural consequences.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings will be published with ISSN, and there will also be an related opportunity for contributions to a special issue of the Journal on Performance Arts and Digital Media; details will be announced soon.\r\n\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects.

However, all submissions must propose an original contribution to Live Coding research, cite relevant previous work, and apply appropriate research methods.\r\n\r\nThe following long list of topics, contributed by early career researchers in the field, are indicative of the breadth of research we wish to include:\r\n\r\n* Live coding and the body; tangibility, gesture, embodiment\r\n* Creative collaboration through live code\r\n* Live coding in education, teaching and learning\r\n* Live coding terminology and the cognitive dimensions of notation\r\n* Live language and interface design\r\n* CUIs: Code as live user interface\r\n* Domain specific languages, and the live coding ecosystem\r\n* Programming language experience design: visualising live process and state in code interfaces\r\n* Virtuosity, flow, aesthetics and phenomenology of live code\r\n* Live coding: composition, improvisation or something else?\r\n* Time in notation, process, and perception\r\n* Live coding of and inside computer games and virtual reality\r\n* Live programming languages as art: esoteric and idiosyncratic systems\r\n* Bugfixing in/as performance\r\n* Individual expression in shared live coding environments\r\n* Live coding across the senses and algorithmic synaesthesia\r\n* Audience research and ethnographies of live coding\r\n* Live coding without computers\r\n* Live coding before Live Coding; historical perspectives on live programming languages\r\n* Heritage, vintage and nostalgia â€“ bringing the past to life with code\r\n* Live coding in public and in private\r\n* Cultural processes of live programming language design\r\n* General purpose live programming languages and live coding operating systems\r\n* Connecting live coding with ancient arts or crafts practice\r\n* Live coding and the hacker/maker movement: DIY and hacker aesthetics\r\n* Critical reflections; diversity in the live coding community\r\n* The freedom of liveness, and free/open source software\r\n\r\nSubmissions which work beyond the above are encouraged, but all should have live coding research or practice at their core. Please contact us if you have any questions about remit.\r\n\r\n### Core organising committee\r\n\r\n* Alex McLean, Co-chair (University of Leeds)\r\n* Thor Magnusson, Co-chair (University of Sussex)\r\n* Kia Ng, Scientific programme committee chair (University of Leeds)\r\n* Shelly Knotts, Artistic programme committee chair (University of Durham)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nPlease email feedback and/or questions to livecodenet@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
