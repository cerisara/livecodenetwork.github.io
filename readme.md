# International Conference on Live Coding - guidelines and templates

# Markdown / commonmark

This is the recommended format, as it allows us to publish your paper both as PDF with print layout, and online as a webpage.

You create markdown documents by writing with text, with simple formatting markup. For example to italicise text, you surround it with asterixes, \*like this\*.

For information about software you can use to make editing markdown straightforward, as well as instructions on how to do easy bibliographic referencing, please refer to the template itself.

# Libreoffice/openoffice template

An "open document format" template, template.odf, is also available, but is not the recommended option. Papers submitted using this format will be published in the proceedings in PDF form, but not as HTML online. The template comes in the form of a word document, where you replace the example text with that of your paper.

# Microsoft word template

A word template, template.docx, is also available, but is not the recommended option. Papers submitted using this format will be published in the proceedings in PDF form, but not as HTML online. The template comes in the form of a word document, where you replace the example text with that of your paper.
