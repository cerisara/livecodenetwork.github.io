# Markdown (commonmark) template

This is the recommended template, use of which will result in your
paper being published online as HTML as well as in PDF form, for
improved "discoverability". 

Markdown is a 'wiki-style' markup language, based on plain text
documents but simple formatting. For example:

* For bulleted lists, place an asterix at the start of each line
* Surround italic text with asterixes *like this*
* Surround bold text with two asterixes **like this**
* Surround footnotes with square brackets preceded by a carat.^[Footnotes look like this]

If you see the above as formatted text, e.g. on github.com, please
view the source of this page to see the markup used to generate it.

For information about software you can use to make editing markdown
straightforward, as well as instructions on how to do easy
bibliographic referencing, please refer to the template itself. The
markdown template is called markdown.md.

# Libreoffice/openoffice template

A "open document format" template, template.odf, is also available,
but is not the recommended option. Papers submitted using this format
will be published in the proceedings in PDF form, but not as HTML
online. The template comes in the form of a word document, where you
replace the example text with that of your paper.

# Microsoft word template

A word template, template.docx, is also available, but is not the
recommended option. Papers submitted using this format will be
published in the proceedings in PDF form, but not as HTML online. The
template comes in the form of a word document, where you replace the
example text with that of your paper.
